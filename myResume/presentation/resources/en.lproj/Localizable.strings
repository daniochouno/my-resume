One of them has been downloaded more than 100,000 times since it was published.\n\nMy strengths are the organization of tasks, my high level of autonomy and the maximum commitment to fidelity in the implementation of functionalities.\n\nWhat motivates me the most and the main reason why I am passionate about my job is to be able to reach out and help anyone who owns a mobile phone, an iPhone, with my apps.\n\nI consider myself a good team worker, open to discuss the best way to develop a feature and collaborate to improve it.";
